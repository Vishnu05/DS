DataStructure And Algorithm

Sorting

Merge
Quick
Heap
Bubble
Insertion
Selection

Time complexity  and space complexity
Big (O)n

Type of measurement in Big-O notations

worst case
best case
average case


linear time
quadratic time?

Merge sort conquer and divide algorithm

selection, bubble, insertion sort are time complexity they take longer time to do that

Arrays

Arrays are like data structure we can store multiple elements in a single varibale
contigous area of memory
we can have constant access to array write, read,

Row Major indexing the column of arrays are turned into rows-- coulms into rows
